# at-2-final-activity-style-your-own-project

In this project, you will use Sass to style-or restyle-a project you've already completed during the extended course!

This project is advantageous for you in several ways. Apart from giving you an additional opportunity to practice what you've learned about writing SCSS and to think about the process of converting CSS to SCSS and vice vers, this project also provides sanctioned time for you to create a powerful asset for your portfolio.

This project will (and should) take longer than one hour. Anything you do not finish in class can be thought of as async work. You are free to work on this project as much as you'd like, even after the topic ends.
